# Research and Development in Finland: Sectorial Foreign Direct Investment Leading to Growth

## Project Overview

This project investigates how Research and Development (R&D) and sectoral Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) contribute to economic growth in Finland. Known for its advanced technologies and strong R&D sector, Finland offers a unique case study for understanding the dynamics between FDI, R&D, and economic growth. This research was conducted as part of a Microprocessors & Interfacing course (CS F241).

## Objectives

- To analyze the impact of sectoral FDI on Finland's economic growth.
- To compare FDI investments in Finland with other Baltic and Nordic countries.
- To evaluate the performance and trends of the R&D sector in Finland, particularly post-COVID-19.
- To investigate the relationship between R&D expenditures and GDP growth in Finland.

## Abstract

The study focuses on the correlation between FDI, R&D, and economic growth in Finland. The research shows that while there is significant FDI inflow into Finland, its impact on the R&D sector and overall economic growth is complex and multifaceted. The findings suggest no statistically significant direct relationship between R&D expenditure and GDP growth. However, sectoral FDI inflows positively correlate with GDP growth, indicating the nuanced role of foreign investments in different economic sectors.

## Introduction

Finland is recognized for its cutting-edge R&D technologies and significant inflow of FDI, which influences its economic landscape. This report examines sector-wise FDI and its normalized net inward flow, comparing it with other nations in the Baltic and Nordic regions. The analysis includes the contributions of different countries to Finland's FDI and an in-depth look at the trends and challenges in Finland's R&D sector, particularly during the post-COVID era.

## Literature Review

The literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of existing research on FDI, R&D, and economic growth. It highlights the theoretical frameworks and empirical studies that underpin the investigation of these variables in the context of Finland.

## Methodology

The research employs regression models to analyze the relationship between sectoral FDI, R&D expenditures, and GDP growth. The methodology includes data collection from reliable sources, statistical analysis to identify trends and correlations, and a comparative study of FDI investments in Finland and other countries in the region.

### Model 1
- **Methodology**: The first model focuses on the direct impact of sectoral FDI on economic growth.
- **Data**: Collected from national and international databases, including OECD and World Bank.
- **Stylized Facts**: Analyzes trends and patterns in FDI and GDP growth.
- **Empirical Results**: Presents the statistical findings and interpretations.

### Model 2
- **Methodology**: The second model examines the interplay between R&D expenditures and economic growth.
- **Data**: Includes detailed R&D investment figures and economic indicators.
- **Stylized Facts**: Provides a sectoral analysis of R&D investments.
- **Empirical Results**: Discusses the significance and implications of the findings.

## Conclusion

The study concludes that Finland's inward FDI stock is relatively low compared to its economic size, and the gap with other economies has widened over the last decade. The R&D sector in Finland has faced challenges in recent years, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and long-term financial crises. There is a negative correlation between FDI and R&D expenditures, but a positive relationship between sectoral FDI inflows and GDP growth.
